This directory contains an example implementation
of a sparse matrix class implemented inheriting
publicly from an STL container, i.e.:

std::vector<std::map<unsigned int, double> >

The directory contains:

sparse.h    :   declaration of the sparse_matrix class
                and of the overloaded operators for
                sparse / full matrix product.

sparse.cpp  :   implementation of the methods defined
                in sparse.h

test_sparse :   demonstration of the use of the
                sparse_matrix class

A Makefile is NOT provided, it is up to you to create one!
For this purpose note that :

  * headers and libraries from the matrix class need to
    be included / linked

  * the matrix class may (depending on the version you
    decide to use) depend on other libraries.
