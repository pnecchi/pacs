Little example of a program that computes the temperature in a bar solving
the steady or unsteady 1D heat equation with a Gauss-Siedel iteration or 
Thomas algorithm. 

Taken and adapted from "Simulation numerique an C++" of I. Danaila, F. Hecht e
   O. Pironneau, 2005

Using gnuplot plot.gnu you ara eble to visualize the results.

make heat_exchange.pdf produce a file with the description of the example.

To execute the code asked in the Challenge:
make 
./run.py
